The code is implemented by Python language with Jupyter notebook. 
It requires numpy, matplotlib, mlxtend, pickle, random and time lib for general purpose.
MLPClassifier from sklearn.neural_network is used as model.
StandardScaler and normalize from sklearn.preprocessing are used for data preprocessing
PCA from sklearn.decomposition is used for PCA.

Main code can be found in main.ipynb.
genetic_algorithm.py includes some GA functions for training.
data_preprocessing includes functions for data preprocessing.
data_loader includes functions for splitting datasets into data loaders.
model.py includes the details of MLP model.
train.py includes the detail code of training.
